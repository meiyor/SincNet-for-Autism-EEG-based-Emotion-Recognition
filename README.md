# SincNet-for-Autism-EEG-based-Emotion-Recognition

This repository is inspired on the original implementation of [SincNet](https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet). Here we modified and adapeted the original SincNet code to evaluate the performance of a SincNet-based architecture for EEG-based emotion recognition. For this evaluation we utilized EEG data collected on the [Social Competence and Treatment Lab](https://www.lernerlab.com/) from StonyBrook University, NY, USA.
The original SincNet paper describing the architecture and test for speech and speaker recognition is here [Ravanelli & Bengio 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05920).
