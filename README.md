# SincNet-for-Autism-EEG-based-Emotion-Recognition

This repository is inspired on the original implementation of [SincNet](https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet). Here we modified and adapt the original code to evaluate SincNet performance on EEG-based emotion recognition
The correspoding SincNet paper is here [Ravanelli & Bengio 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05920)
