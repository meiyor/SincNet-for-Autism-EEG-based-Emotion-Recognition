# SincNet-for-Autism-EEG-based-Emotion-Recognition

This repository is inspired on the original implementation of [SincNet](https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet). Here we modified and adapeted the original SincNet code to evaluate the performance of a SincNet-based architecture for EEG-based emotion recognition. For this evaluation we utilized EEG data collected on the [Social Competence and Treatment Lab (SCTL)](https://www.lernerlab.com/) from StonyBrook University, NY, USA. The EEG data were collected from 40 individual diagnosed with Autism-Spectrum-Disorder (ASD) and 48 typically-developed (TD) or non-ASD participants. For any data request (e.g., behavioral, EEG) or anaylysis, pleased send an email to the corresponding contributors at juan.mayortorres@unitn.it, mirco.ravanelli@gmail.com, or matthew.lerner@stonybrook.edu.The original SincNet paper describing the architecture and the corresponding test on speech and speaker recognition is here [Ravanelli & Bengio 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05920).

The proposed SincNet-based architecture for EEG-based emotion recognition is described on the following Figure:
